        <h2>Below is a guide to prepare Kenyan chapati</h2>
        <P>From my stay in Kigali, Rwanda, it turned out that 
            many people love the Kenyan chapati, so I decided 
            to create a recipe to help 
            those who'd love to prepare it themselves at home.
        </P>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup warm water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <!--This makes 10-12 chapatis-->
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the dough</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combine whole wheat flour, salt, and water in a large bowl to form a shaggy dough.</li>
                    <li>Knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic. Adjust water or flour as needed.</li>
                    <li>Form into a ball, place in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Roll out the chapati</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the dough into equal balls.</li>
                    <li>Roll each ball into a thin circle on a floured surface. Thinner dough makes fluffier chapati.</li>
                    <li>Brush with melted ghee for extra flavor if desired.</li>
                </ul>
    
            <li><strong>Cook the chapati</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a griddle or tawa over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Place the rolled dough on the hot pan, cooking until bubbles appear (30 seconds to 1 minute).</li>
                    <li>Flip and cook until light brown spots form (another 30 seconds to 1 minute). Press with a spatula to create puffs.</li>
                    <li>For a flakier chapati, add a bit of oil or ghee around the edges while cooking the second side.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transfer cooked chapati to a plate or roti basket, covering with a clean cloth to keep warm.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with beef and potato stew.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
